# macOS Swift App

A scratch project for a MacOS App written in Swift without any non-programmatic manifest files, using AppKit.
The event loop is controlled explicitly.

This projects consists of a single file, whose contents can be pasted into a file and compiled from the command line using `swiftc`.
The built executable displays an empty window with the known MacOS title bar and close button.

The source code is taken from [here](https://nexo.dev/post/2019/04/27/how-to-open-window-in-macos-programmatically-using-swift/).
